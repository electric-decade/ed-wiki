# Electric Decade
The 2020s will see an unprecedented shift away from fossil fuels in peoples daily lives. The solutions are already available. This site provides a community run resource to answer questions and demonstrate how to shift to a low carbon electric lifestyle. Updating your car, kitchen, hot water or heating is not something done every day. But when you're ready, this site should provide the answers you need to make a confident and informed choice.

## Future electric living
The electric decade concept is to provide you with a model of a typical household that has stopped using fossil fuels in daily life. We will provide the up-front costs and the on-going costs.  There won't be a focus on payback periods or comparisons to fossil fuel solutions. All the data is out there, we just need to get hold of it and provide a template of how it is done.
