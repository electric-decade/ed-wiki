# Electric Decade
The 2020s will see an unprecedented shift away from fossil fuels in peoples daily lives. The solutions are already available. This site provides a community run resource to answer questions and demonstrate how to shift to a low carbon electric lifestyle. Updating your car, kitchen, hot water or heating is not something done every day. But when you're ready, this site should provide the answers you need to make a confident and informed choice.

If you are interested in helping with this site in any capacity (writing content, editing, marketing, site management or any other way), please check out the [about](/about) page for details on how to join and help make this a valuable resource for all.

The site has only just been created, so there's not much more than a skeleton right now. If you'd like to be notified when we're more established sign up for our [mailing list](https://cdn.forms-content.sg-form.com/e2d4fd56-2dd1-11ea-a60a-6e213710e2d3). We won't share your details and will send at most one email a month.
