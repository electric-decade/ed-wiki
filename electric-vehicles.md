# Electric Vehicles
Over the last ten years battery electric vehicles have been developed to the point that they now offer a real and useful alternative to the internal combustion engine. 


### If I charge off the grid at night won't that generate more carbon?

No. A [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328782184_Where_are_we_heading_with_electric_vehicles) by the University of Queensland shows that an electric vehicles will produce 20% less carbon even if charged off Victoria's brown coal powered grid. The article, ["Clean, green machines: the truth about electric vehicle emissions"](http://theconversation.com/clean-green-machines-the-truth-about-electric-vehicle-emissions-122619) on The Conversation by the same authors is also worth a read.

### Can I charge an electric vehicle from solar panels?

Yes. The Australian PV institute says the average Australian [solar pv system size](https://pv-map.apvi.org.au/analyses) is currently 7kw. That will produce an average of 28kwh of energy a day.  That's enough to energy to drive an electric vehicle over 180km.
