# Electric Vehicles
Over the last ten years battery electric vehicles have been developed to the point that they now offer a real and useful alternative to the internal combustion engine. 


### If I charge off the grid at night won't that generate more carbon?

No. A [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328782184_Where_are_we_heading_with_electric_vehicles) by the University of Queensland shows that an electric vehicles will produce 20% less carbon even if charged off Victoria's brown coal powered grid. The article, ["Clean, green machines: the truth about electric vehicle emissions"](http://theconversation.com/clean-green-machines-the-truth-about-electric-vehicle-emissions-122619) on The Conversation by the same authors is also worth a read.

### Can I charge an electric vehicle from solar panels?

Yes. The Australian PV institute says the average Australian [solar pv system size](https://pv-map.apvi.org.au/analyses) is currently 7kw. That will produce an average of 28kwh of energy a day.  That's enough energy to drive an electric vehicle over 180km. If your car is at home an hour or two in sunlight every day and you drive less than 200km a week you'd never pay for to drive.

### Won't I need to replace the battery?

Not likely. Electric vehicles in general come with an eight year and 160,000km warranty.  There are [stories of people driving their electric vehicle over 1million km](https://thedriven.io/2019/11/29/tesla-model-s-busts-ev-myths-with-historic-1-million-kilometres-driven/) having only replaced the battery once. So a single battery has lasted over 500,000km. Tesla is also [taking out patents aiming](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a30346407/tesla-patent-battery-chemistry/) to build batteries that last over 1.6 million km (1 million miles).

### Aren't electric vehicles expensive?

Yes, but it depends on your budget. Unfortunately for many people with a budget of less than $50,000 AUD for a car, an electric vehicle is too expensive.  However, if your budget stretches to this and beyond an electric car has lower running costs and lower servicing costs than other cars.
