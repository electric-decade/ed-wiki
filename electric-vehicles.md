# Electric Vehicles
Over the last ten years battery electric vehicles have been developed to the point that they now offer a real and useful alternative to the internal combustion engine. 


### If I charge off the grid at night won't that generate more carbon?

No. A [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328782184_Where_are_we_heading_with_electric_vehicles) by the University of Queensland shows that an electric vehicles will produce 20% less carbon even if charged off Victoria's brown coal powered grid. The article, ["Clean, green machines: the truth about electric vehicle emissions"](http://theconversation.com/clean-green-machines-the-truth-about-electric-vehicle-emissions-122619) on The Conversation by the same authors is also worth a read.

### Can I charge an electric vehicle from solar panels?

Yes. The Australian PV institute says the average Australian [solar pv system size](https://pv-map.apvi.org.au/analyses) is currently 7kw. That will produce an average of 28kwh of energy a day.  That's enough energy to drive an electric vehicle over 180km. If your car is at home an hour or two in sunlight every day and you drive less than 200km a week you'd never pay for to drive.

### Won't I need to replace the battery?

Not likely. Electric vehicles in general come with an eight year and 160,000km warranty.  There are stories of people driving their electric vehicle over 1million km having only replaced the battery once. So a single battery has lasted over 500,000km.
