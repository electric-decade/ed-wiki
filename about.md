# About
The electric decade web site was created on the 1st of January 2020.  The site will aim to provide people with useful information to aid in making the switch away from fossil fuels in their daily life.  Our daily use of fossil fuels is embedded as part of our houses, so making the switch can be a slow process.  However, when the kitchen is being renovated, the hot water breaks, or a new car is on the cards, this site will provide the information to go electric.

## Stone Soup
This website is being put together and run using the Stone Soup recipe.

> Some travelers come to a village, carrying nothing more than an empty cooking pot. Upon their arrival, the villagers are unwilling to share any of their food stores with the hungry travelers. Then the travelers go to a stream and fill the pot with water, drop a large stone in it, and place it over a fire. One of the villagers becomes curious and asks what they are doing. The travelers answer that they are making "stone soup", which tastes wonderful and which they would be delighted to share with the villager, although it still needs a little bit of garnish, which they are missing, to improve the flavor.
> 
> The villager, who anticipates enjoying a share of the soup, does not mind parting with a few carrots, so these are added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the travelers again mention their stone soup which has not yet reached its full potential. The villager hands them a little bit of seasoning. More and more villagers walk by, each adding another ingredient. Finally, the stone (being inedible) is removed from the pot, and a delicious and nourishing pot of soup is enjoyed by travelers and villagers alike. Although the travelers have thus tricked the villagers into sharing their food with them, they have successfully transformed it into a tasty meal which they share with the donors. 

I've thrown the stone in by creating the nearly empty website. I'm looking forward to people joining in and helping with what will hopefully become a great resource.

I originally saw the Stone Soup story as part of one of the earliest open source projects called Fractint. A fractal generation program from the late 80s.  What made it great was the large number of people that contributed and improved on the software. Hopefully, this story will now inspire others to help make electric-decade.
