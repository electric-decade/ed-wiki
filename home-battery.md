# Home Battery
A home battery is able to provide the electricity to your house at night to allow your to reduce your dependency on the electricity grid.

### Aren't home battery solutions expensive
Yes, but the price is coming down. [Bloomberg reports](https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-fall-as-market-ramps-up-with-market-average-at-156-kwh-in-2019/) that battery prices in 2010 were $1,600 AUD ($1100 USD)  per kilowatt-hour.  In 2019 the price is around $224 AUD ($156 USD) per kilowatt-hour. By 2023 the prediction is that it will be $143 USD ($100 USD) per kilowatt-hour.  So while it may not make economic sense to buy a home battery today, it will do in the future.

These prices have not yet filtered down to home batteries.  Solar choice has [tracked battery system prices since 2018](https://www.solarchoice.net.au/blog/battery-storage-price).  A Tesla powerwall for instance is currently $10,000 AUD for a 13.5kwh battery. That is $750 AUD per kilowatt-hour.
